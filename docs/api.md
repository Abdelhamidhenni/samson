# API

Many endpoints offer a `.json` response, open PRs for missing ones, there is also a deprecated & dedicated `/api` endpoint.

Api authentication is done via OAuth tokens and scopes.
Users can use an OAuth flow to request access or create their own personal access tokens and then use them via api clients.
